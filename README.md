# Conversational-Commerce 

## WHY

Trade has relied on conversation for millennia. This iOS app makes the effort to know neighborhood businesses easier. 

## LONG TERM GOAL

* Ask iOS App: "Recommend me a birthday gift for a 5 yro who likes animals and sweet flavors for about $20"
* Human receives recommendations from neighborhood businesses fitting those parameters instantly. The goal is tie these conversations with the routine of walking to the neighborhood store to pickup the recommended goods. Ultimately, my hope is to slow down the pace of city life.
