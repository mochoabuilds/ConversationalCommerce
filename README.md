# Conversational-Commerce 

## WHAT

* iOS App for Conversational Commerce -- **Conveniently message the Local Chamber of Commerce and its partnered businesses questions such as... "Please recommend me a birthday gift for a 5 yro who likes animals and sweet flavors for about $20"... and recieve recommendations back from partnered businesses.**

## WHY

* Trade has relied on conversation for millennia. This iOS app makes direct messaging local businesses easier. The app is also a testbed for a neighborhood to get a peek at a market design that doesn't yet exist in their neighborhood (e.g. digital wallets for autonomous checkout , pedicab services. etc ).  Hopefully this proof of concept provides a more integrated view of how humans might interact with businesses in the future.  My hope its one that is more sustainable as we live on a finite planet with biophysical limits.
