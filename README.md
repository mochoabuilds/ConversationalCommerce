# Conversational-Commerce 

## WHAT

* iOS App for Conversational Commerce 
* Conveniently message the chamber of commerce and its participating neighborhood businesses questions such as... **"Please recommend me a birthday gift for a 5 yro who likes animals and sweet flavors for about $20"**... and recieve useful answers back

## WHY

* Trade has relied on conversation for millennia. This iOS app makes the effort to know local businesses easier. The app is also a testbed for a neighborhood to get a peek at a market design that doesn't yet exist in their neighborhood.  Hopefully this approach provides a more integrated view of how humans might interact in the future (to design a more sustainable future as we live on a finite planet with biophysical limits).
